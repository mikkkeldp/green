Explanation:

I ran the ant command followed by the ant test command. By examining the `build.xml` file, I noticed that the output directory was set to bin. This lead me to the `all-test.html` file where I was presented with the output:


expected:<[1*v+-1<0]> but was:<[1*v+-1<=0]>


This indicated that my condition for test20 was incorrect. I then changed the corresponding less than the a less than or equals which lead to all my tests passing.
